# S8. Star Wars

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A website with information about `Star Wars spaceships.`

We will consume API data, displaying it on the screen in a list, and we will implement the detail of each item in the list.

# ðŸš€ Level 1

## `Exercise 1`

To begin with, the first step we are going to implement the main screen where the list of spaceships are displayed.

When we get the list of items from the server, we are going to see that it returns many interesting data about each spaceship, but on the main screen we will only show the most important data so as not to overload the cliente with information.

Data to show for each spaceship on the list:

- Spaceship name
- Model
